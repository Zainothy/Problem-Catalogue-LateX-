  A collection of hellish maths and physics problems, lacking boundarie and pushing the will of an A-Level student. These problems break down their understanding of maths and physics fundamentally. No form of revision or study at their age aids in the misery bestowed upon them via these problems.

  \subsubsection{Worked Solution:}
  \[I_{1} = \int_{\int_{x}^{2x}(lnx)^{2}}^{(3+x)^{6}}(\frac{1}{3e^{x}\cos x \sec^{2} x} + \cot x \csc x) \ dx \]
  \(\Rightarrow \ I_{1}=\int_{b}^{a} f(x) dx\) \\

  \(\therefore \ let \ I_{2}=b\) \\
  \[I_2=\int_{x}^{2x}(\ln|x|)^{2}= \int^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}u^{2}e^{u}du=[u^{2}e^{u}]^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}-\int^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}2ue^{u}e^{u}du\] \\
  \[= [u^{2}e^{u}]^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}- ([2ue^{u}]^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}- \int ^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}2e^{u}du=[u^{2}e^{u}] ^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}-[2ue^{u}-2e^{u}]^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}=[u^{2}e^{u}-2ue^{u}-2e^{u}]^{2e^{u}}_{e^{u}}\] \\
  \[=[x(\ln |x|)^{2}-2x\ln|x|-2x]^{2x}_{x} \because u=\ln|x| \Rightarrow e^{u}=x \] \\
  \(\therefore I_2=x[2(\ln |2x|)^{2}-(\ln |x|)^{2}-\ln |16x^{2}|]\) (\text{This result \(\rightarrow\) from evaluating the bounds}) \\
  \[I_1= \int^{(3+x)^{6}}_{I_{2}} (\frac{1}{3e^{x}\cos x \sec^{2} x} + \cot x \csc x) \ dx = \int^b_a(\frac{1}{3e^{x}\cos x \sec^{2} x)} + \int^{b}_{a} \cot x \csc x\] \\
  \[let \ I_{3}= \int^b_a(\frac{1}{3e^{x}\cos x \sec^{2} x)} = \int^b_a(\frac{1}{3e^{x}\sec x)}dx = \frac{1}{3} \int^b_a(e^{-x}\cos x)dx\] \\
  \[I_{3}=1/3(J) \] \\
  \[J=[-e^{-x}\cos x]^b_a - \int^b_a -e^{-x}\sin x = [-e^{-x}\cos x]^b_a-([-e^{-x}\sin x]^b_a-\int^b_ae^{-x}cosx\] \\
  \[J=[-e^{-x}\cos x]^b_a-[e^{-x}\sin x]^b_a-J \] \\
  \[\therefore \ J=\frac{1}{2}[e^{-x}\sin x-e^{-x}\cos x]^b_a\] \\
  \[\therefore \ I_{3}=\frac{1}{6}[e^{-x}\sin x-e^{-x}\cos x]^b_a\] \\
  \[I_{1}=I_{3}+\int^b_a\cot x \csc x \ dx\] \\
  \[ let \ I_{4}= \int^b_a\cot x \csc x \ dx\] \\
  \[I_{4}= \int^b_a (\frac{1}{\sin x})(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}) \ dx = \int^b_a \frac{\cos x}{1-\cos^{2} x} \ dx \] \\
  \textbf{Integrate \(I_4\) by parts:}
  \[ I_{4}=\int^b_a \frac{\cos x}{\sin^{2} x} \ dx\] \\
  \[= \int^b_a \cos x ( \frac{1}{\sin^{2} x}) \ dx = [\frac{1}{\sin x}]^b_a-\int^b_a \sin x ( \frac{-2\sin x\cos x}{\sin^{4} x}) \ dx = [\frac{1}{\sin x}]^b_a-\int^b_a \frac{-2 \cos x}{\sin x} \ dx \] \\
  \[ \therefore I_{4}= [\frac{1}{\sin x}]^b_a+ 2I_{4}\] \\
  \[\Rightarrow I_{4}=-\frac{1}{\sin x} \]
  \[ \therefore I_{1}= [I_{3}+I_{4}]^b_a \]

  A tank is formed by rotating the line segment joining \((y,\rho)=(0,1)\) and \((6,2)\)
  in the \((y,\rho)\) plane (height \(y\), radius \(\rho\)) about the \(y\)–axis.
  The tank has height \(6\,\mathrm{m}\) and is completely full at time \(t=0\).
  There is no inflow, and water drains through a valve at the bottom.

  Let \(h\) denote the depth of water measured upward from the bottom
  (\(0 \le h \le 6\)), and let \(r\) be the radius of the water surface when the depth is \(h\).
  Let \(V(h,r)\) denote the volume of water at that moment.

  Conservation of volume gives
  \[
    \frac{dV}{dt}=-Q_{\mathrm{out}}(h),
  \]
  where \(Q_{\mathrm{out}}(h)\) is the volumetric outflow rate in \(\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{min}\).

  The valve operates in two phases.
  In each phase the outflow is constant, and its value is given by a definite integral:

  \medskip

  \textbf{Phase I} (for \(6 \ge h \ge 3\)):
  \[
    Q_{\mathrm{out}}(h)=K_{1}, \qquad
    K_{1}=c_{1}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
    \frac{|\ln|x||}{(x^{2}+1)(x-1)}\,dx,
    \qquad
    c_{1}=0.12\ \text{(m}^3/\text{min per unit integral)}.
  \]

  \medskip

  \textbf{Phase II} (for \(3>h\ge 0\)):
  \[
    Q_{\mathrm{out}}(h)=K_{2}, \qquad
    K_{2}=c_{2}\int_{0}^{\pi/2} x^{3}\tan x\,dx,
    \qquad
    c_{2}=0.15\ \text{(m}^3/\text{min per unit integral)}.
  \]

  \medskip

  Determine the sum of the magnitudes of the rates at which the water height
  is decreasing when \(h=4.25\) and when \(h=1\).\\

  \subsection{\underline{Problem One:}}
  \textbf{IMO 2011}

  Let \(S\) be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points of \(S\) are collinear. A windmill is a process that starts with a line \(\ell\) going through a single point \(P \in S\). The line rotates clockwise aboutthe pivot \(P\) until the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to S. This point, \(Q\), takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about \(Q\), until it next meets a point of \(S\). This process continues indefinitely. Show that we can choose a point \(P\) in \(S\) and a line \(\ell\) going through \(P\) such that the resulting windmill uses each point of \(S\) as a pivot infinitely many times.

  Imagine Let \(T_{1}\) be a tetrahedron and let \(S_{1}\) be its circumsphere with radius \(R\).
  For each radius of \(S_{1}\), extend it to a full line and denote this line by \(\ell\).

  In the plane \(z = 0\), consider a circle \(C_{1}\) which circumscribes an equilateral triangle whose sides are tangent to the coordinate axes \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\).  Thus the triangle has one vertex at the origin and its other two vertices lie on the positive coordinate axes.

  Suppose that for certain choices of the radius of \(S_{1}\), the corresponding line \(\ell\) intersects the plane \(z = 0\) and is tangent to the circle \(C_{1}\).  The set of all such tangent lines \(\ell\) is finite.

  Determine, in terms of \(R\), the area of the circle \(C_{1}\).

  Figure 1.1 shows a right-angled triangle \(\triangle ABC\) of height \(H\), divided vertically by a straight line \(\ell\) such that it meets the triangle at a point defined by the variable \(\phi\). The division of \(\triangle ABC\) splits it at \(\phi\) into a trapezium \(CD{\phi}A\) and a new right angled triangle \(\triangle DB{\phi}\). Deduce the value(s) for \(\phi\) that divides \(\triangle ABC\) such that the area of \(CD{\phi}A\) is equal to that of \(DB{\phi}\).

  \section{Principles Regarding Infinity}
  \subsection{\underline{Human Knowledge}}
  George Berkeley, in his \emph{Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge}, explores the idea that man is disillusioned by the incomprehensible nature of infinity, a conciousness that is finite is incapable of comprehending that of the infinite. From this, he goes on to reject the notion of abstract, mind-independent material substance given that it is incomprehensible to a finite being. He, instead, asserts that reality consists only of finite minds and infinite minds- with god's boundless perception being the primary reason for the conceptualisation of the infinite.
  \newline \\
  Shifting to a mathematical perspective, we see Berkeley reject the mathematical interpretations of infinitesimals and infinite quantities, he believes them to be incoherent and undefineable within man's finite perception of reality.
  This is seen in how he attacks the notion of \textbf{fluxions}, referring to them as the /say{ghosts of departed quantities}.
  Further exploring this idea of the comprehensibility of that of the infinite, we can see that his perspective regarding such critiques the usage of abstraction in order to conceptualise.
  He attacks the notion of /say{infinitely small} values, enforcing the idea that a conceptualisation must stem from real, percieved ideas as opposed to abstraction.
  \newline \\
  However, Berkeley didn't directly oppose the usage of mathematical abstraction in reasoning, despite the fact that he rejected the notion of abstraction, he credited the need for a way to quantify infinite concepts and acknowledged the practical usage of algebraic methods, but for Berkeley this was never the true perception of these principles.
  His primary focus remained on the belief that true knowledge comes from perception, and as such, could not philisophically accept the conceptualisation of the inperceivable infinite.
  As such, mathematical concepts that dealt with the infinite were subject to this belief until they reduced the infinite to something that is percievable, a finite quantity.

  \subsubsection{Burning Questions:}
  This rejection of abstract conceptualisation regarding the finite thus implies that it is impossible for the finite being that is man to idealise infinity, however man interacts with infinity in the physical world regularly-
  the physics explaining our interactions with the world are beyond that of the abstract,
  they are real and applicable.
  Despite this, they utilise the abstract concepts that are imaginary numbers and infinite quantites at the low-level.
  As such, how could this philosophical approach reason with physical concepts regarding the infinite?
  \newline \\
  \subsection{Mathematical Approaches to The Infinite}
  Aristotle, as one of the early thinkers surrounding infinity, introduced some of the foundational abstract concepts that later allowed for mathematical practicalisation of infinite quantities.
  In Book 3 of his works, titled \emph{Physics}, he deals with the infinite in regards to actuality and potentiality.
  He states,
  \say{It is always possible to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be bisected is infinite. Hence the infinite is potential, never actual; the number of parts that can be taken always surpasses any assigned number.}
